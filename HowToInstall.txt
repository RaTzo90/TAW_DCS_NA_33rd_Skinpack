HOW TO INSTALL:

IMPORTANT: ENSURE you install the main releases first, and then apply patches after.

For Example at the time of writing we have TAW_NA_Skins_V2_1.zip 
as the highest full skin pack and NA_Skins_Patch_V2_6.zip which is a patch to the main skinpack. 

So, you would install V2_1 first and then install the V2_6 patch to bring all your skins up to the
latest versions. 

To install simply extract the zip files into whichever folder you normally use for your skins. 
It is highly recommended for you to use a folder in your Saved Games folder and not the main
DCS World install folder.
